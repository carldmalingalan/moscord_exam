# Moscord Exam E-Commerce

By Carl Dennis M. Alingalan

Here's to the [Demo site](https://shielded-inlet-68609.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

First create a `.env` file within the root folder.

```bash
$ touch .env
```

Then in the file add these few lines of code.

```bash
PORT=5000
MongoURI=mongodb://localhost/moscord_exam
```

Lastly install `node_modules` with both root and client folder.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install --prefix client
```

## Summary

On creation of this app. I mostly follow the instruction given and came up with some basic functionality of a e-commerce app. But there's some of the functionality that I see quite interesting while creating.

- Inline updating of Seller's information
- Consistent cart details (When you add an item inside the cart even if you refresh it will remain)
- Seller Report that would dropdown all of its respective items and show its details.

**Hope this would be in your liking** ðŸ˜Š
